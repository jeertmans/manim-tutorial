# Tutorial Slides

This directory contains everything to generate the slide used for the tutorial.

Assuming you have correctly installed Manim and Jupyter, see the main [README](../README.md) document, you can generated the slides with:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert slides/Slides.ipynb --to slides --post serve
```

And that's all!
